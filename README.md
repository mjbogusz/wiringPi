# DOES NOT WORK
As per #3, this version of the library is broken on actual Raspberry Pi-s.

The only project I know of that was using this library, my [VL53L0X driver](https://github.com/mjbogusz/vl53l0x-linux)
will soon drop the depencency.

This repo will not be deleted in case anyone wants to use it as a reference -
e.g. switching Makefile-based project to CMake or such.
